This is just a project from back in my sophmore year, it was one of our finals and we ended up getting a good grade from it. My partner worked more of the look and design of the website while i worked on the js behind it.

In this project, the use of javascript was needed to retrieve information from the NYC Open data library by the API key. We used this to collect information on Squirrels for the information chart. 
We also used the json viewer to correctly determine all the information we wanted to include. Finally, we worked on putting everything together in a HTML website where not only can the user view all this information,
but can also interact with it by using a search bar created in Javascript. We also made an interactable Bar and Pie Chart by the use of some math and some extra code through more Javascript.
